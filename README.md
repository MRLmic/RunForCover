<h1>Run For Cover</h1>
<h3>A Full Stack Project/Work In Progress by Melissa Luna</h3>

<h2>A Song Tracking App</h2>

<a href="https://mrlmic.github.io/rfcFront/">See it Live</a>
<p>This app allows you to keep track of songs that you like and whether they were originally performed by the artist.</p>

<p>The app works by adding songs to SQL databases. The songs are displayed using Handlebars. The app checks to see if the logged in user's id matches the user id reference column before allowing changes to any songs.</p>

<p>In the future, I would like to enable the user to push their songs to a game database. The game would prompt the user with a song title and artist and ask them if the song was originally performed by this person.</p>

<h2>Tech</h2>
<p>The front end of this project utilizes Javascript, HTML/CSS, Ajax, & jQuery</p>

<p>The back end of this project utilizes Ruby on Rails and is hosted on a Heroku server.</p>
